            <p class="Para-Div">Talwar, also known as the Tulwar or Talavari, was a type of curved sword that was commonly used by the Maratha army under the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj. The Talwar was one of the most versatile and effective weapons in the Maratha arsenal and played a significant role in many battles during the 17th century.Design of Talwar used to be a slightly curved, single-edged blade that was sharpened on the inner edge. The blade was typically 2 to 3 feet in length and was wider near the hilt and tapered towards the tip. The Talwar was designed for both cutting and thrusting, and its unique curve made it an effective weapon for both offense and defence.Shivaji Maharaj himself was a skilled Talwar fighter and was known to use the weapon in battle. He trained his soldiers extensively in the use of the Talwar, and it became one of the most important weapons in the Maratha arsenal.
            Talwar was effective against both infantry and cavalry, and its curved blade was especially useful in close-quarters combat. In the Maratha Empire, soldiers used to deliver quick and precise strikes with Talwar. They used to slash at their opponentsâ€™ limbs and capable of making deep cuts in their bodies with the Talwar. The Talwar was also effective against armoured opponents, as its curved blade allowed it to bypass the gaps in the armor.
            It was not only used for combat but was also a symbol of honor and prestige. Shivaji Maharaj often presented Talwars as gifts to his loyal soldiers and commanders, and the weapon became a prized possession of the Maratha warriors.</p>
