                A fort is a fortified place built for military defense. It's typically a strong building or complex of buildings surrounded by walls, ditches, or other obstacles to protect against attacks.The English word "Fort" is derived from the <span>Latin word 'Fortis'</span> meaning strong. Fort is known in the local language as 'killa' (Qila in Urdu).They were naturally and artificially protected human settlements, guarded by elements like the hills, the forests, the desert, the sea, and the man-made stone structures that formed an armor around them.   
                <br>
                One of the early references to forts in the subcontinent occurs in the ancient political treatise 'Arthashastra' by Kautilya.
                The forts in Maharashtra were constructed since the time of some of its early ruling dynasties: Satvahanas, Rashtrakutas, Kadambas, Chalukyas, Yadavas, Afghans, Bahmanis, Gonds, Sultanates of Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Berar, Siddis, British, Portuguese, and last but not least the Marathas.
