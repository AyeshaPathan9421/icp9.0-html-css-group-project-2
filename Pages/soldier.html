        <h2 class="text_center">Bahirji Naik</h2>
        <p>
    Bahirji Naik, (original name Bhairavnath Jadhav), was a 17th century Maratha spy and head of intelligence department in the army of Shivaji. Bahirji was honoured with title of "Naik" (transl. Chief) by King Shivaji due to his great work.As Shivaji’s Chief of Intelligence, he was very successful in his methods.His tomb is currently situated on Bhupalgad (Banurgad) in Khanapur taluka of Sangli district. He was born in the village of Shingave Naik, Ahmednagar. In 1592, Bahirji's son, Tukoji Naik, built Ram Mandir and the outer border of the Shingave village. A stone bearing an inscription of his name is kept in the Ram Mandir.[citation needed]
Not much is or was known about the early life of Bahirji, except that his expeditions and adventures as a spy in Shivaji's army greatly contributed to the success of the Maratha Empire.

  Role during wars:
It is said that when a knight from Adil Shah, Afzal Khan, started his journey towards the Maratha Empire in order to capture it, Bahirji poisoned the lead flag-bearing elephants. This led to the enemy abandoning the quest. (The death of a flag-bearing elephant was considered a bad omen.)
In Umbar Khind, a mountain pass near Lonavala, Shivaji ambushed and defeated the 20,000-strong army of Colonel Kartalab Khan, a well-known military officer of Shahiste Khan, in the Battle of Umberkhind. This victory is attributed to Bahirji's intelligence collection. Shivaji captured valuable military equipment and accepted the deserters from Khan's army into his own</p>

    <h3 class="text_center">Hambirrao Mohite</h3>
    <p>Hambirrao Mohite (1630–1687), also known as Hansaji, was a prominent Maratha general who held the esteemed position of the 5th Senapati of the Maratha Army during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji.He was recognized for his exceptional military prowess and successfully led various campaigns on behalf of Shivaji, subsequently continuing his service under Chhatrapati Sambhaji.Hambirrao's true name was Hansaji, and the title Hambir Rao was bestowed upon him by Chhatrapati Shivaji in 1674. His descendants continued the title of Hambir Rao.
      Accession of Sambhaji
        After the demise of Chhatrapati Shivaji in 1680, Soyarabai, who was Hambirrao's sister, attempted to displace Sambhaji from the throne in favor of her own 10-year-old son, Rajaram. Hambirrao was temporarily absent from Raigad, and he was urgently called back. Upon his return, his sister earnestly implored him to secure the army's backing for her son as the future Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire. Hambirrao traveled to Panhala with the initial intent of apprehending Sambhaji but ultimately switched his allegiance, offering support to Shivaji's elder son over his own sister. This action played a pivotal role in securing Sambhaji's ascension on throne and thwarting the conspiracy devised by Soyarabai.
        
        Attack on Burhanpur
        Main article: Sacking of Burhanpur (1681)
        On January 30, 1681, Burhanpur, a prominent trade center connecting southern and northern India, witnessed a sudden attack by Hambirrao Mohite and Chhatrapati Sambhaji. During this time, Jehan Khan served as the Subahdar of Burhanpur, and the city's garrison comprised only 200 soldiers. In contrast, Hambirrao commanded a formidable army of 20,000 troops. The Mughals found themselves unable to effectively resist Hambirrao's forces, resulting in substantial losses for them. In this battle, the Marathas seized assets exceeding a value of 1 crore rupees.
        Later on 17 March 1683, Hambirrao emerged victorious in a battle against Ranamast Khan, a formidable chieftain in the service of Aurangzeb, near the vicinity of Kalyan-Bhiwandi.</p>
